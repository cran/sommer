\strong{m}ixed \strong{m}odel \strong{e}quations for \strong{c} coefficients

}
\description{

The \code{mmec} function uses the Henderson mixed model equations and the Average Information algorithm coded in C++ using the Armadillo library to optimize matrix operations common in problems with sparse data (e.g., genotype by environment models). This algorithm is \strong{intended to be used for problems of the type r > c (more records in the data than coefficients to estimate)}. For problems with of the type c > r (more coefficients to estimate than records available), the direct inversion algorithms are faster and we recommend to shift to the use of the \code{\link{mmer}} function.

\usage{

mmec(fixed, random, rcov, data, W, nIters=25, tolParConvLL = 1e-03,
     tolParConvNorm = 1e-04, tolParInv = 1e-06, naMethodX="exclude",
     naMethodY="exclude", returnParam=FALSE, dateWarning=TRUE,
     verbose=TRUE,addScaleParam=NULL, stepWeight=NULL, emWeight=NULL)
}
\arguments{
  \item{fixed}{A formula specifying the \strong{response variable(s)} \strong{and fixed effects}, i.e:

  \emph{response ~ covariate}

  }

  \item{random}{A formula specifying the name of the \strong{random effects}, e.g., \emph{random= ~ genotype + year}.

  Useful functions can be used to fit heterogeneous variances and other special models (\emph{see 'Special Functions' in the Details section for more information}):

  \code{\link{vsc}(...,Gu)} is the main function to specify variance models and special structures for random effects. On the ... argument you provide the unknown variance-covariance structures (e.g., usc,dsc,at,csc) and the random effect where such covariance structure will be used (the random effect of interest). Gu is used to provide known covariance matrices among the levels of the random effect. Auxiliar functions for building the variance models are:

  ** \code{\link{dsc}(x)}, \code{\link{usc}(x)}, \code{\link{rrc}(x,y,z)} , \code{\link{isc}(x)},\code{\link{csc}(x)}, and \code{\link{atc}(x,levs)} can be used to specify unknown diagonal, unstructured, reduced-rank, identity, and customized unstructured and diagonal covariance structures respectively to be estimated by REML.

  ** \code{\link{unsm}(x)}, \code{\link{fixm}(x)} and \code{\link{diag}(x)} can be used to build easily matrices to specify constraints in the Gtc argument of the \code{\link{vsc}()} function.

  ** \code{\link{overlay}()}, \code{\link{spl2Dc}()}, and \code{\link{leg}()}, \code{\link{redmm}()} functions can be used to specify overlayed of design matrices of random effects, two dimensional spline, random regression, and dimensionality-reduction models within the \code{\link{vsc}()} function.

  }
  \item{rcov}{A formula specifying the name of the \strong{error term}, e.g., \emph{rcov= ~ units}.

  Special heterogeneous and special variance models and constraints for the residual part are the same used on the random term but the name of the random effect is always "units" which can be thought as a column with as many levels as rows in the data, e.g., \emph{rcov=~vsc(dsc(covariate),isc(units))}

  When fitting structures at the level of residuals please make sure that your data is sorted based on the factors defining the structure. For example, for \emph{rcov= ~ vsc(dsc(xx), isc(units))} sort the datatset by the variable xx.

  }
  \item{data}{A data frame containing the variables specified in the formulas for response, fixed, and random effects.}
  \item{W}{Weights matrix (e.g., when covariance among plots exist). Internally W is squared and inverted as Wsi = solve(chol(W)), then the residual matrix is calculated as R = Wsi*O*Wsi.t(), where * is the matrix product, and O is the original residual matrix.}
   \item{nIters}{Maximum number of iterations allowed.}
  \item{tolParConvLL}{Convergence criteria based in the change of log-likelihood between iteration i and i-1.}
  \item{tolParConvNorm}{Convergence criteria based in the norm proposed by Jensen, Madsen and Thompson (1997):

  e1 = || InfMatInv.diag()/sqrt(N) * dLu ||

  where InfMatInv.diag() is the diagonal of the inverse of the information matrix, N is the total number of variance components, and dLu is the vector of first derivatives.

  }
  \item{tolParInv}{Tolerance parameter for matrix inverse used when singularities are encountered in the estimation procedure.}
   \item{naMethodX}{One of the two possible values; "include" or "exclude". If "include" is selected then the function will impute the X matrices for fixed effects with the median value. If "exclude" is selected it will get rid of all rows with missing values for the X (fixed) covariates. The default is "exclude". The "include" option should be used carefully.}
   \item{naMethodY}{One of the three possible values; "include", "include2" or "exclude" (default) to treat the observations in response variable to be used in the estimation of variance components. The first option "include" will impute the response variables for all rows with the median value, whereas "include2" imputes the responses only for rows where there is observation(s) for at least one of the responses (only available in the multi-response models). If "exclude" is selected (default) it will get rid of rows in response(s) where missing values are present for at least one of the responses.}
   \item{returnParam}{A TRUE/FALSE value to indicate if the program should return the parameters to be used for fitting the model instead of fitting the model.}
   \item{dateWarning}{A TRUE/FALSE value to indicate if the program should warn you when is time to update the sommer package.}
  \item{verbose}{A TRUE/FALSE value to indicate if the program should return the progress of the iterative algorithm.}
  \item{addScaleParam}{additional scale parameters for the thetaF matrix.}
  \item{stepWeight}{A vector of values (of length equal to the number of iterations) indicating the weight used to multiply the update (delta) for variance components at each iteration. If NULL the 1st iteration will be multiplied by 0.5, the 2nd by 0.7, and the rest by 0.9. This argument can help to avoid that variance components go outside the parameter space in the initial iterations which happens very often with the AI method but it can be detected by looking at the behavior of the likelihood. In that case you may want to give a smaller weight.}
  \item{emWeight}{A vector of values (of length equal to the number of iterations) indicating with values between 0 and 1 the weight assigned to the EM information matrix. And the values 1 - emWeight will be applied to the AI information matrix to produce a joint information matrix. By default the function gives a weight to the EM algorithm of a logarithmic decrease rate using the following code \code{logspace(nIters,1,0.05)}.

\strong{Special variance structures}

 \code{\link{vsc}(\link{atc}(x,levels),isc(y))}

 can be used to specify heterogeneous variance for the "y" covariate at specific levels of the covariate "x", e.g., \emph{random=~vsc(at(Location,c("A","B")),isc(ID))} fits a variance component for ID at levels A and B of the covariate Location.

 \code{\link{vsc}(\link{dsc}(x),isc(y))}

 can be used to specify a diagonal covariance structure for the "y" covariate for all levels of the covariate "x", e.g., \emph{random=~vsc(dsc(Location),isc(ID))}  fits a variance component for ID at all levels of the covariate Location.

 \code{\link{vsc}(\link{usc}(x),isc(y))}

 can be used to specify an unstructured covariance structure for the "y" covariate for all levels of the  covariate "x", e.g., \emph{random=~vsc(usc(Location),isc(ID))}  fits variance and covariance components for ID at all levels of the covariate Location.
 
 \code{\link{vsc}(\link{usc}(\link{rrc}(x,y,z,nPC)),isc(y))}

 can be used to specify an unstructured covariance structure for the "y" effect for all levels of the  covariate "x", and a response variable "z", e.g., \emph{random=~vsc(rrc(Location,ID,response, nPC=2),isc(ID))}  fits a reduced-rank factor analytic covariance for ID at 2 principal components of the covariate Location.

  \code{\link{vsc}(isc(\link{overlay}(...,rlist=NULL,prefix=NULL)))}

 can be used to specify overlay of design matrices between consecutive random effects specified, e.g., \emph{random=~vsc(isc(overlay(male,female)))} overlays (overlaps) the incidence matrices for the male and female random effects to obtain a single variance component for both effects. The `rlist` argument is a list with each element being a numeric value that multiplies the incidence matrix to be overlayed. See \code{\link{overlay}} for details.Can be combined with vsc().
 
   \code{\link{vsc}(isc(\link{redmm}(x,M,nPC)))}

 can be used to create a reduced model matrix of an effect (x) assumed to be a linear function of some feature matrix (M), e.g., \emph{random=~vsc(isc(redmm(x,M)))} creates an incidence matrix from a very large set of features (M) that belong to the levels of x to create a reduced model matrix. See \code{\link{redmm}} for details.Can be combined with vsc().

  \code{\link{vsc}(\link{leg}(x,n),isc(y))}

  can be used to fit a random regression model using a numerical variable \code{x} that marks the trayectory for the random effect \code{y}. The leg function can be combined with the special functions \code{dsc}, \code{usc} \code{at} and \code{csc}. For example \emph{random=~vsc(leg(x,1),isc(y))} or \emph{random=~vsc(usc(leg(x,1)),isc(y))}.

  \code{\link{spl2Dc}(x.coord, y.coord, at.var, at.levels))}

  can be used to fit a 2-dimensional spline (e.g., spatial modeling) using coordinates \code{x.coord} and \code{y.coord} (in numeric class) assuming multiple variance components. The 2D spline can be fitted at specific levels using the \code{at.var} and \code{at.levels} arguments. For example \emph{random=~spl2Dc(x.coord=Row,y.coord=Range,at.var=FIELD)}.

\strong{Covariance between random effects}

 \code{\link{covc}( \link{vsc}(\link{isc}(ran1)), \link{vsc}(\link{isc}(ran2)) )}

 can be used to specify covariance between two different random effects, e.g., \emph{random=~covc( vsc(isc(x1)), vsc(isc(x2)) )} where two random effects in their own vsc() structure are encapsulated. Only applies for simple random effects.
 
\strong{S3 methods}

S3 methods are available for some parameter extraction such as \code{\link{fitted.mmec}}, \code{\link{residuals.mmec}}, \code{\link{summary.mmec}}, \code{\link{randef}}, \code{\link{coef.mmec}}, \code{\link{anova.mmec}}, \code{\link{plot.mmec}}, and \code{\link{predict.mmec}} to obtain adjusted means. In addition, the \code{\link{vpredict}} function (replacement of the pin function) can be used to estimate standard errors for linear combinations of variance components (e.g., ratios like h2). The \code{\link{r2}} function calculates reliability. 


\strong{Additional Functions}

Additional functions for genetic analysis have been included such as relationship matrix building (\code{\link{A.mat}}, \code{\link{D.mat}}, \code{\link{E.mat}}, \code{\link{H.mat}}),  build a genotypic hybrid marker matrix (\code{\link{build.HMM}}), plot of genetic maps (\code{\link{map.plot}}), and manhattan plots (\code{\link{manhattan}}). If you need to build a pedigree-based relationship matrix use the \code{getA} function from the pedigreemm package.

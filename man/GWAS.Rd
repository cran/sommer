Genome wide association study analysis

\description{

Fits a multivariate/univariate linear mixed model GWAS by likelihood methods (REML), see the Details section below. It uses the \code{\link{mmer}} function and its core coded in C++ using the Armadillo library to opmitime dense matrix operations common in the derect-inversion algorithms. After the model fit extracts the inverse of the phenotypic variance matrix to perform the association test for the "p" markers. Please check the Details section (Model enabled) if you have any issue with making the function run.

The package also provides functions to estimate additive (\code{\link{A.mat}}), dominance (\code{\link{D.mat}}), and epistatic (\code{\link{E.mat}}) relationship matrices to model known covariances among genotypes typical in plant and animal breeding problems. Other functions to build known covariance structures among levels of random effects are autoregresive (\code{\link{AR1}}), compound symmetry (\code{\link{CS}}) and autoregressive moving average (\code{\link{ARMA}}) where the user needs to fix the correlation value for such models (this is different to estimating unknown covariance structures). Additionally, overlayed models can be implemented as well (\code{\link{overlay}} function). Spatial modeling can be done through the two dimensional splines (\code{\link{spl2D}}). Random regression models can also be fitted through the (\code{\link{leg}}) function (orthopolynom package installation is needed for using the leg function).

The sommer package is updated on CRAN every 3-months due to CRAN policies but you can find the latest source at https://github.com/covaruber/sommer . This can be easily installed typing the following in the R console:

library(devtools)

install_github("covaruber/sommer")

This is recommended since bugs fixes will be immediately available in the GitHub source. \strong{For tutorials} on how to perform different analysis with sommer please look at the vignettes by typing in the terminal:

GWAS(fixed, random, rcov, data, weights, 
    iters=20, tolpar = 1e-03, tolparinv = 1e-06, 
    init=NULL, constraints=NULL,method="NR",

    M=NULL, gTerm=NULL, n.PC = 0, min.MAF = 0.05, 
    n.core = 1, P3D = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
  \item{fixed}{A formula specifying the \strong{response variable(s)} \strong{and fixed effects}, i.e:
  
  \emph{response ~ covariate} for univariate models
  
  \emph{cbind(response.i,response.j) ~ covariate} for multivariate models
  
  The \code{\link{fcm}()} function can be used to constrain fixed effects in multi-response models.
  
  }
  
  \item{random}{a formula specifying the name of the \strong{random effects}, i.e. \emph{random= ~ genotype + year}.
  
  Useful functions can be used to fit heterogeneous variances and other special models (\emph{see 'Special Functions' in the Details section for more information}):
  
  \code{\link{vs}(...,Gu,Gt,Gtc)} is the main function to specify variance models and special structures for random effects. On the ... argument you provide the unknown variance-covariance structures (i.e. us,ds,at,cs) and the random effect where such covariance structure will be used (the random effect of interest). Gu is used to provide known covariance matrices among the levels of the random effect, Gt initial values and Gtc for constraints. Auxiliar functions for building the variance models are:
  
  ** \code{\link{ds}(x)}, \code{\link{us}(x)}, \code{\link{cs}(x)} and \code{\link{at}(x,levs)} can be used to specify unknown diagonal, unstructured and customized unstructured and diagonal covariance structures to be estimated by REML.
  
  ** \code{\link{unsm}(x)}, \code{\link{uncm}(x)}, \code{\link{fixm}(x)} and \code{\link{diag}(x)} can be used to build easily matrices to specify constraints in the Gtc argument of the \code{\link{vs}()} function.
  
  ** \code{\link{overlay}()}, \code{\link{spl2D}()}, and \code{\link{leg}()} functions can be used to specify overlayed of design matrices of random effects, two dimensional spline and random regression models within the \code{\link{vs}()} function.
  
  }
  \item{rcov}{a formula specifying the name of the \strong{error term}, i.e. \emph{rcov= ~ units}.
  
  The functions that can be used to fit heterogeneous residual variances are the same used on the random term but the random effect is always "units", i.e. \emph{rcov=~vs(ds(Location),units)}
  
  }
  \item{data}{a data frame containing the variables specified in the formulas for response, fixed, and random effects.}
  \item{weights}{name of the covariate for weights. To be used for the product R = Wsi*R*Wsi, where * is the matrix product, Wsi is the square root of the inverse of W and R is the residual matrix.}
   \item{iters}{Maximum number of iterations allowed.  Default value is
    15.}
  \item{tolpar}{Convergence criteria.}
  \item{tolparinv}{tolerance parameter for matrix inverse used when singularities are encountered.}
  \item{init}{initial values for the variance components. By default this is NULL and variance components are estimated by the method selected, but in case the user want to provide initial values for ALL var-cov components this argument is functional. It has to be provided as a list or an array, where each list element is one variance component and if multitrait model is pursued each element of the list is a matrix of variance covariance components among traits. Initial values can also be provided in the Gt argument of the \link{vs} function.Is highly encouraged to use the Gt and Gtc arguments of the \link{vs} function instead of this argument}
  \item{constraints}{when initial values are provided these have to be accompanied by their constraints. See the \link{vs} function for more details on the constraints. Is highly encouraged to use the Gt and Gtc arguments of the \link{vs} function instead of this argument.}
  \item{method}{this refers to the method or algorithm to be used for estimating variance components. Direct-inversion Newton-Raphson \strong{NR} and Average Information \strong{AI} (Tunnicliffe 1989; Gilmour et al. 1995; Lee et al. 2015), and \strong{EMMA} efficient mixed model association (Kang et al. 2008).}
  \item{getPEV}{a TRUE/FALSE value indicating if the program should return the predicted error variance and variance for random effects. This option is provided since this can take a long time for certain models where p > n by a big extent.}
   \item{na.method.X}{one of the two possible values; "include" or "exclude". If "include" is selected then the function will impute the X matrices for fixed effects with the median value. If "exclude" is selected it will get rid of all rows with missing values for the X (fixed) covariates. The default is "exclude". The "include" option should be used carefully.}
   \item{na.method.Y}{one of the three possible values; "include", "include2" or "exclude". If "include" is selected then the function will impute the response variables with the median value. The difference between "include" and "include2" is only available in the multitrait models when the imputation can happen for the entire matrix of responses or only for complete cases ("include2"). If "exclude" is selected it will get rid of rows in responses where missing values are present for the estimation of variance components. The default is "exclude".}
   \item{return.param}{a TRUE/FALSE value to indicate if the program should return the parameters used for modeling without fitting the model.}
   \item{date.warning}{a TRUE/FALSE value to indicate if the program should warn you when is time to update the sommer package.}
  \item{verbose}{a TRUE/FALSE value to indicate if the program should return the progress of the iterative algorithm.}
  \item{M}{The marker matrix containing the marker scores for each level of the random effect selected in the gTerm argument, coded as {-1,0,1} = {aa,Aa,AA}, levels (i.e. individuals) in rows and markers in columns. No additional columns should be provided, is a purely numerical matrix.}
  \item{gTerm}{a character vector indicating the random effect linked to the marker matrix M (i.e. the genetic term) in the model. The random effect selected should have the same number of levels than the number of rows of M.}
  \item{n.PC}{Number of principal components to include as fixed effects. Default is 0 (equals K model).}
  \item{min.MAF}{Specifies the minimum minor allele frequency (MAF). If a marker has a MAF less than min.MAF, it is assigned a zero score.}
  \item{n.core}{Setting n.core > 1 will enable parallel execution on a machine with multiple cores (use only at UNIX command line).}
  \item{P3D}{When P3D=TRUE, variance components are estimated by REML only once, without any markers in the model. When P3D=FALSE, variance components are estimated by REML for each marker separately.}

\strong{Models Enabled}

For details about the models enabled and more information about the covariance structures please check the help page of the package (\code{\link{sommer}}). In general the GWAS model implemented in sommer to obtain marker effect is a generalized linear model of the form:

b = (X'V-X)X'V-y

with X = ZMi

where:
b is the marker effect (dimensions 1 x mt)
y is the response variable (univariate or multivariate) (dimensions 1 x nt)
V- is the inverse of the phenotypic variance matrix (dimensions nt x nt)
Z is the incidence matrix for the random effect selected (gTerm argument) to perform the GWAS (dimensions nt x ut)
Mi is the ith column of the marker matrix (M argument) (dimensions u x m)

for t traits, n observations, m markers and u levels of the random effect. Depending if P3D is TRUE or FALSE the V- matrix will be calculated once and used for all marker tests (P3D=TRUE) or estimated through REML for each marker (P3D=FALSE).

\strong{Special Functions}

 \code{\link{vs}(\link{at}(x,levels),y)}   
 
 can be used to specify heterogeneous variance for the "y"" factor covariate at specific levels of the factor covariate "x", i.e. \emph{random=~vs(at(Location,c("A","B")),ID)} fits a variance component for ID at levels A and B of the factor covariate Location.
  
 \code{\link{vs}(\link{ds}(x),y)}   
 
 can be used to specify a diagonal covariance structure for the "y"" covariate for all levels of the factor covariate "x", i.e. \emph{random=~vs(ds(Location,ID)}  fits a variance component for ID at all levels of the factor covariate Location.
  
 \code{\link{vs}(\link{us}(x),y)}   
 
 can be used to specify an unstructured covariance structure for the "y"" covariate for all levels of the factor covariate "x", i.e. \emph{random=~vs(us(Location),ID)}  fits variance and covariance components for ID at all levels of the factor covariate Location.
 
  \code{\link{vs}(\link{overlay}(...,rlist=NULL,prefix=NULL))}   
 
 can be used to specify overlay of design matrices between consecutive random effects specified, i.e. \emph{random=~overlay(male,female)} overlays (overlaps) the incidence matrices for the male and female random effects to obtain a single variance component for both effects. The `rlist` argument is a list with each element being a numeric value that multiplies the incidence matrix to be overlayed. See \code{\link{overlay}} for details.Can be combined with vs().
  
  \code{\link{vs}(\link{spl2D}(x.coord, y.coord, at, at.levels, type, 
      nseg, pord, degree, 
      nest.div))}
      
  can be used to fit a 2-dimensional spline (i.e. spatial modeling) using coordinates \code{x.coord} and \code{y.coord} (in numeric class). The 2D spline can be fitted at specific levels using the \code{at} and \code{at.levels} arguments. For example \emph{random=~spl2D(x.coord=Row,y.coord=Range,at=FIELD)}.

\strong{Example Datasets}

The package has been equiped with several datasets to learn how to use the sommer package: 

* \code{\link{DT_halfdiallel}} and \code{\link{DT_fulldiallel}} datasets have examples to fit half and full diallel designs. 

* \code{\link{DT_h2}} to calculate heritability

* \code{\link{DT_cornhybrids}} and \code{\link{DT_technow}} datasets to perform genomic prediction in hybrid single crosses 

* \code{\link{DT_wheat}} dataset to do genomic prediction in single crosses in species displaying only additive effects.

* \code{\link{DT_cpdata}} dataset to fit genomic prediction models within a biparental population coming from 2 highly heterozygous parents including additive, dominance and epistatic effects. 

* \code{\link{DT_polyploid}} to fit genomic prediction and GWAS analysis in polyploids. 

* \code{\link{DT_gryphon}} data contains an example of an animal model including pedigree information.

* \code{\link{DT_btdata}} dataset contains an animal (birds) model.

\strong{Additional Functions}

Other functions such as \code{\link{summary}}, \code{\link{fitted}}, \code{\link{randef}} (notice here is randef not ranef), \code{\link{anova}}, \code{\link{variogram}}, \code{\link{residuals}}, \code{\link{coef}} and \code{\link{plot}} applicable to typical linear models can also be applied to models fitted using the GWAS-type of functions. 

Additional functions for genetic analysis have been included such as heritability (\code{\link{h2.fun}}), build a genotypic hybrid marker matrix (\code{\link{build.HMM}}), plot of genetic maps (\code{\link{map.plot}}), creation of manhattan plots (\code{\link{manhattan}}). If you need to use pedigree you need to convert your pedigree into a relationship matrix (i.e. use the \code{getA} function from the pedigreemm package). 

Useful functions for analyzing field trials are included such as the \code{spl2D}, \code{\link{spatPlots}}, and \code{\link{fill.design}}.

Description: Structural multivariate-univariate linear mixed model solver for estimation of multiple random effects with unknown variance-covariance structures (e.g., heterogeneous and unstructured) and known covariance among levels of random effects (e.g., pedigree and genomic relationship matrices) (Covarrubias-Pazaran, 2016 <doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0156744>; Maier et al., 2015 <doi:10.1016/j.ajhg.2014.12.006>). REML estimates can be obtained using the Direct-Inversion Newton-Raphson and Direct-Inversion Average Information algorithms. Designed for genomic prediction and genome wide association studies (GWAS), particularly focused in the p > n problem (more coefficients to estimate than observations). Spatial models can also be fitted using the two-dimensional spline functionality available in sommer.
